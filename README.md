# Digital Image Processing Practicum

This repository contains my semester practicum projects and Python implementations for fundamental digital image processing techniques. The collection demonstrates core concepts using OpenCV and Matplotlib, covering operations from basic image handling to advanced computer vision methods.

## üìÅ Project Contents

| Script Name | Key Functionality |
|-------------|-------------------|
| `color_segmentation.py` | HSV color space segmentation with red color detection |
| `edge_detection_methods.py` | Comparative edge detection (Sobel, Canny, Laplacian) |
| `morphological_operations.py` | Binary operations: erosion, dilation, opening, closing |
| `contour_analysis.py` | Contour detection with geometric measurements |
| `edge_detection_sobel_canny_laplacian.py` | Alternative edge detection implementation |
| `color_and_threshold_segmentation.py` | Hybrid color/threshold segmentation approach |
| `basic_image_loading_display.py` | Fundamental image I/O and visualization |
| `morphological_transformations_demo.py` | Structural element transformations |
| `contour_features_extraction.py` | Advanced contour property extraction |
| `threshold_and_edge_based_segmentation.py` | Combined thresholding-edge segmentation |

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Place your input image (`mypic.jpg`) in the project directory
2. Run any script:

```bash
python color_segmentation.py
python edge_detection_methods.py
# Similarly for other scripts
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Core Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Python Version**: 3.x+

Install requirements:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

## üîç Key Concepts Implemented

- Multiple color space conversions
- Thresholding techniques (global, adaptive)
- Edge detection algorithms
- Morphological image processing
- Contour analysis and shape features
- Comparative visualization methods

## üìù Usage Notes

1. All scripts expect `mypic.jpg` as input
2. Adjustable parameters are documented in each script
3. Designed for educational purposes - modify thresholds/kernels to experiment
